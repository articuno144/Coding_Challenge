"""
Battleship Environment. This environment implements a simple one player version of the Battleship game where the player
has to sink all a-priori invisible ships as fast as possible by dropping bombs onto the playing field.
At the beginning of each episode 10 ships are placed onto the 10x10 grid:
 - 1 ship of 4 grid cells length (air plane carrier)
 - 2 ships of 3 gird cells length each (battle cruisers)
 - 3 ships of 2 grid cells length each (frigates)
 - 4 ships occupying a single grid cell (submarines)
Ships are placed such that no ship is directly adjacent or overlapping any other ship.
To play the game, an agent should create the environment through gym (gym.make('Battleship-v0')), reset it to get the
initial state and then iteratively call the step function to drop bombs.
States are given by a tensor of shape (10, 10, 1), i.e., a gray scale image of 10x10 pixels, where a value of 0.0
encodes no knowledge about the particular field, 0.5 encodes a miss in the given field and 1.0 encodes a hit in the
given field.
Actions handed to the environment must be two dimensional (representing x and y coordinate) and lie within the range
[0,1] to be counted as valid.
Invalid actions will result in a reward of -1.0
Hits will result in a reward of 1.0
Misses will result in a reward of -0.1
